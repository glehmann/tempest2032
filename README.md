# T2K

A small Tempest 2000-inspired desktop prototype written in Rust and Bevy 0.18.
The first level uses the original game's irregular 16-sided `web5` outline
and straight extrusion. Blue lane surfaces fade into the tunnel, and yellow
edges mark the glider's current lane. The solid gold glider uses the original
`sclaw0` through `sclaw7` vertex layouts, with shaded faces and a thin extruded
body. The claw stays at each lane's midpoint while fractional movement progress
selects its rolling pose. The pose order accounts for this prototype's reversed
vertex ordering. It holds its pose when stopped.

An offset perspective camera follows half the claw's displacement at a capped
speed, so it continues settling after the claw stops. A sparse colored
starfield fills the background. All geometry is generated in code, and no
external assets are needed.

## Run

Install Rust 1.89 or newer, then run from this directory:

```sh
cargo run
```

The first build compiles Bevy and takes longer than subsequent builds.
For an optimized build, use `cargo run --release`.

On Linux, the build needs a C/C++ toolchain and X11 and Wayland development
libraries. On Debian or Ubuntu, install `build-essential`, `pkg-config`,
`libx11-dev`, `libxi-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`,
`libxkbcommon-dev`, and `libwayland-dev`. Running needs a graphical desktop
and a Vulkan-capable graphics driver. Windows and macOS use their native
window backends.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left arrow or A | Move counterclockwise |
| Right arrow or D | Move clockwise |
| Enter, numpad Enter, or Space | Fire, hold for repeat fire |
| R | Restart level one |
| Escape | Quit |

Hold a movement key to accelerate around the rim. The 60 Hz simulation uses
the original 16:16 movement values, acceleration `0x400` per tick and maximum
velocity `0x6000`. That reaches 22.5 lanes per second after 24 ticks.
Movement wraps around all 16 lanes and stops when the key is released.
Changing direction stops the claw for one tick before accelerating backwards.
Opposite directions held together cancel each other.

Shots launch from the current lane and travel straight down the tunnel.
They stay in their launch lane as the claw moves. The normal weapon fires
every four simulation ticks, with up to eight shots in flight, and removes
each shot at the rear opening. Shots are small, bright green projectiles.

## First-level enemies

Level one uses the original `_nw1` wave of normal Flippers. Their X-shaped
bodies use `s_flipper`'s seven vertices and four triangular faces, exactly as
the source lays them out.

Shading is matched to the original renderer rather than to a literal reading of
the data. `s_flipper` gives each face a CRY hue of `F0` or `F4` plus a
per-vertex intensity, which suggests a Gouraud gradient from dark arm tips to a
bright centre. Sampling a real screenshot shows otherwise: a Flipper renders
as four flat pure-red facets, with no green channel and no gradient along an
arm. So each face takes one flat shade from its brightest source intensity,
scaled so the brightest facet reaches 240 of red. This is a deliberate
departure from the raw data, chosen because it reproduces what the game
actually displays.

Flippers first approach as small red points from beyond the rear opening.
Their approach takes 150 ticks, then they climb their lane at the original
`0xA000` depth speed. At the rim they pivot about a lane boundary toward the
player, taking the shortest route around the closed web. A pivot advances
four of the Jaguar's 256 angle units per tick. They pause between flips and
can be shot in the destination lane during the latter part of a flip.

The first spawn is after 61 ticks, with further spawns every 121 ticks when
there is room. The source's duration counter yields 25 enemies. Clearing all
of them completes the level. Each Flipper is worth 150 points.

Climbing Flippers also fire at the player. Level one allows one enemy shot
in flight. It uses `s_shot`'s three rotating chevrons, shaded with the original
purple and yellow-green CRY colors. Enemy shots travel toward the rim at
`0x18000` depth units per tick, and your shots can intercept them.

A Flipper or enemy shot that catches the claw on the rim costs a life. You
start with three lives. Losing a life resets the wave and gives two seconds
of invulnerability.
Press **R** to restart, or replay after clearing the level. This prototype
replays level one rather than advancing to another web.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo check
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

`src/main.rs` contains the scene setup, claw movement, and firing systems.
`src/enemies.rs` contains the Flipper geometry, wave generator, enemy state
machine, collisions, score, and lives. The prototype has no audio or power-ups.
Actors render in a separate camera pass over the web, matching the original
renderer's draw order and keeping complete enemy silhouettes visible.

To capture the level for visual comparisons, run:

```sh
cargo run -- --screenshot target/level-01.png
```

The app saves the window after 60 frames and exits. The output directory
must already exist.

To record a scripted movement comparison, run:

```sh
cargo run -- --record-motion target/motion
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i target/motion/%04d.png -vf "pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p target/motion.mp4
```

The six-second sequence includes firing, acceleration in both directions,
stopping, wrapping, and camera settling. It saves screenshots roughly every two
simulation ticks, then exits. Use a fresh output directory for each recording.
The encoded video is a visual preview; screenshot timing can vary with GPU load.
An optional duration extends the capture, for example
`cargo run -- --record-motion target/enemies 15` to see enemies reach the rim.

## Original geometry references

The source references used for this prototype are in the original game's
`src/yak.s` and `src/obj2d.s`:

- `raw_webs` selects `web5` for the first level.
- `web5` defines the 16 ring vertices on a 2-to-14 coordinate grid.
- `extrude` repeats the same XY coordinates at a depth of 40 units.
- `vp_set` and `vp_xform` move the viewpoint toward the player's position.
- `clawcon` accelerates the claw and stops it before reversing direction.
- `domove` positions the claw at the selected lane's midpoint.
- `sclaw0` through `sclaw7` define the solid claw's movement poses.
- `dsclaw` selects one of those eight poses from the fractional lane position.
- `sclawr`, `frab`, and `player_shot` control repeat firing and shot travel.
- `_nw1`, `setnewgen`, and `newgen` define level-one enemies and spawn timing.
- `s_flipper` and `fverts` define the solid Flipper faces and vertices.
- `make_flipper`, `ipix`, and `r_obj` define the distant-point approach.
- `fz_stuff`, `rospeeds`, and `pauses` define the level-one movement parameters.
- `stdrail`, `flip_set`, `flipto`, and `stdstop` implement climbing and rim pivots.
- `collie` defines shot vulnerability and the six-unit depth collision threshold.
- `scores` assigns 150 points to a normal Flipper.
- `alienfire`, `run_ashot`, `s_shot`, and `chevron` define enemy firing and shots.

The CRY hue-to-RGB lookup used to check those colors comes from
[Virtual Jaguar's TOM implementation](https://github.com/libretro/virtualjaguar-libretro/blob/master/src/tom/tom.c).
It decodes `F4` to a red-orange, but the reference screenshot shows no green on
a Flipper at all, which is why this prototype does not use that value.

The camera framing and colors are tuned to the supplied screenshot rather
than reproducing the Jaguar's renderer exactly.
